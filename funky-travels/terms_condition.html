                <p>The participant is solely responsible for arranging and paying for their own travel to and from the program destination, as well as any local transport costs. It is also the responsibility of the participant to obtain and carry all necessary documentation such as visas and passports, when traveling abroad. While <b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> may provide advice and guidance to the participant in regards to the required travel documentation, <b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> is not responsible for the accuracy of its advice or providing or obtaining any supporting documents necessary for the participant’s travel needs, such as visas, medical certificates, or travel permits. Participants are responsible for ensuring their travel documents are up to date and valid for travel.</p>

                <h4>Insurance</h4>
                <p><b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> does not provide the participant with insurance of any kind.

This must cover their entire travel period.</p>

                <h4>Program Fees</h4>
                <p>Participation on an internship program requires full payment of the relevant program fee as set out on the <b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> website at the time when the participant submitted their application. <b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> reserves the right to revise program fees at any time and any fee revisions will be made public via the <b>‘Funky Fresh’</b> website.

No credits will be provided less than sixty (60) days before the scheduled start date.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

Where a participant elects to make payment in a different currency, the conversion rate applied on payments and any eligible refunds will be based on the exchange rate charged by our payment provider at the time the payment or refund is processed.
